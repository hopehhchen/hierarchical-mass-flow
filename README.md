# Hierarchical Mass Flow
Code deposit for the hierarchical mass flow project.

## Notes on Hope's code
1. Three different schemes:
  * 3D cubes/dendrogram/surface flux
  * 2D maps/dendrogram/gradient across
  * 2D maps/circular apertures/gradient across
2. Denpendencies (could actually be lower; below is what has been tested):
  * `numpy`: 1.17.3
  * `astropy`: 3.2.1
  * `pandas`: 0.24.2
  * `astrodendro`: 0.2.0
  * `skimage`: 0.15.0
3. See inline comments for explanations.
4. See an example in `example.ipynb`.
